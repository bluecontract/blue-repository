  Conversation workflow step that enqueues an event as part of the workflow.

  - Gas accounting (when & what is charged):
      - Base step charge (once per run of this step): 30.
      - Expression/template resolution under "/event" (if present):
          - For each standalone expression ${…}: 5 + ceil(bytes(expr)/100).
          - For each template string containing one or more ${…} placeholders:
            3 × placeholderCount + ceil(bytes(template)/100).
          - Any document(<pointer>) used inside expressions/templates charges
            per call: 8 + depth(pointer) + ceil(snapshotBytes/100).
      - Event emission (enqueue): 20 + ceil(eventBytes/100) for the final event
        payload after expression resolution.
