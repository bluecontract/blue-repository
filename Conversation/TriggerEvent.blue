name: Trigger Event
type: Conversation/Sequential Workflow Step
description: >
  Conversation workflow step that enqueues an event as part of the workflow.

  - Gas accounting (when and what is charged):
      - Base step charge (once per run of this step): 30.
      - Expression/template resolution under "/event" (if present):
          - Expressions run in the deterministic QuickJS VM (same sandbox and
            bindings as the JavaScript Code step).
          - VM gas is converted to host gas as:
            hostGas = ceil(wasmFuel / 1700)
            (calibration factor currently 1700 fuel per host gas unit).
          - Any document(<pointer>) used inside expressions/templates charges
            per call: 8 + depth(pointer) + ceil(snapshotBytes/100).
      - Event emission (enqueue): 20 + ceil(eventBytes/100) for the final event
        payload after expression resolution.
