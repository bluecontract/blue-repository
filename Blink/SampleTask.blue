                Prepare a json like:
                {
                  "note": "Put note here",
                  "move": {
                    "from": "e2",
                    "to": "e4"
                  }
                }
                you're recommending this move to someone playing chess
                note should be max 160 chars and should sound like:
                'Time to activate our queen now. This move also frees up the d8 square for your rook, improving piece coordination'
                or
                'Let's throw a haymaker now! Taking on c7 we're protecting the c-pawn. You have 61% chances of winning now.'
                or
                'It's over now! We'll force mate in 3 moves. Let's start by taking this rook.'
                those are just examples, be creative, don't use it as a pattern - your comments should be interesting and enjoying
